## 🚀 Overview

**Job Shield** is an AI-powered fake job advertisement detection system built using Natural Language Processing and machine learning. The aim is to prevent job seekers from falling prey to fraudulent job postings.

🔍 It uses:
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction via TF-IDF
- Supervised learning for classification

## 🏗️ Features

- ✅ Clean and preprocess job ad text
- 🧹 Remove stopwords, symbols, and HTML tags
- 📌 TF-IDF vectorization for text data
- 🤖 Train multiple ML models to classify fake vs real jobs
- 📊 Visualize model performance

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Libraries:**  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn  
  - NLTK  
  - Tkinter (for GUI, if applicable)

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean HTML tags, lowercase text, remove punctuation
   - Tokenization, stopword removal

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
   - Convert job description into numerical vectors

3. **Model Training**
   - Split into training & test sets
   - Train and evaluate classifiers

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix
